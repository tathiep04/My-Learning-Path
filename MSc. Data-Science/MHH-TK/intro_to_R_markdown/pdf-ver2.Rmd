# Preprocessing

## Choosing the data

This task will use the penguins dataset. Let's working with it

The source is taking from [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=43347)
To catching anything, you need to

> quote out like this

to make an empty line, simply add '<br>' like this

Penguins is cute!

## Loading the dataset, reading data

First, I would like to:

1. Load *packages*  
2. Read the data  
3. **Remove missing values**  
<br>
To add an images, you use: <br>
![Penguin species](C:/Users/hiepa/OneDrive/Documents/AAA-SELFSPACE/MHH-TK/penguin-species.png){width=60%}

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# load the dataset from OpenML Library
d <- OpenML::getOMLDataSet(data.id = 43347)
# convert the OpenML object to a tibble (enhanced data.frame)
penguins <- d %>% dplyr::as_tibble()
#skimmed_penguins <- skimr::skim(penguins)
head(penguins)
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Run again the code abow
library(tidyverse)
head(penguins)
```
How the output and the code itself shows up in the document also be modified:  

- 'echo = FALSE': only output is visible  
- 'include = FALSE' hides both output and code  
- 'warning = FALSE' to suppress warning message (also works with errors and message)  
- 'eval = FALSE': code is not run

## Removing missing data
```{r}
# Before removing na_values
nrow(penguins)
# After removing
penguins <- penguins %>% drop_na()
nrow(penguins)
```
Or we can write like this. I had removed missing values, so the data now only has `r nrow(penguins)` rows.



## Descriptive statistics
The mean bill length is `r mean(penguins$bill_length_mm)` mm.
<br>
The bill depth is between `r min(penguins$bill_depth_mm)` and `r max(penguins$bill_depth_mm)`

# Graphs

Some ideas for the graphs:  

* weight by flipper length  
  + for the entire data  
  + separately for each species  
  + additionally by sex  
* flipper and bill length
